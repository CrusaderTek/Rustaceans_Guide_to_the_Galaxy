This is a heavily modified example of the egui keypad example found here: https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/examples/custom_keypad

There is currently not a good way to enter text into egui widgets on android so I caved and made a crappy keyboard.

This is still a work in progress but should run. Keyboard currently does not fit properly on phones but works great on tablets.
