This is a heavily modified example of the egui keypad example found here: https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/examples/custom_keypad

There is currently not a good way to enter text into egui widgets on android so I caved and made a crappy keyboard.

This is still a work in progress but should run provied you complete the prerequisites: https://github.com/CrusaderTek/Rustaceans_Guide_to_the_Galaxy/blob/main/prerequisits/prerequisites.md
and the work around in: https://github.com/CrusaderTek/Rustaceans_Guide_to_the_Galaxy/tree/main/egui_example
. Keyboard currently does not fit properly on phones but works great on tablets.
